## Setup

Add any packages or libraries you want here
```{r}
rm(list=ls()) # clear any previous stuff real quick

if(!require('sna')) {
  install.packages('sna')
  library('sna')
}

if (!"igraph" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("igraph")

sessionInfo() # this just prints out the packages, just to double check that the imports worked as expected
```

Setup the data

```{r}
###################### IMPORTANT################
setwd('***') # replace *** with directory path
################################################

# generate dataframes from the dataset
large_twitch_edges <- read.csv("large_twitch_edges.csv") # stuff in parentheses needs to match the file name of the dataset
large_twitch_features <- read.csv("large_twitch_features.csv")

# Take a subset of the data
twitch_edges <- large_twitch_edges[0:2000,] # can change the 2000 to however many rows you want
twitch_features <- large_twitch_features[0:2000,] # these and the large versions above are "dataframes", whatever those are

# alternative data formats for the data
twitch_edge_matrix <- data.matrix(twitch_edges) # matrix format
twitch_edge_graph <- graph_from_data_frame(twitch_edges) # graph format
twitch_network <- as.network.matrix(twitch_edges, matrix.type = "edgelist") # generates a network
```


## Social Network Analysis
Actually do some Social Networks stuff finally

```{r}
# these do what you would expect, make sure that you ran the package importing chunk first
centralization(twitch_network,g=3,degree)
betweenness(g)

# one way to generate a visualization
plot(tiny_graph, vertex.size = 8, 
     layout = layout_with_fr(tiny_graph) )
```
